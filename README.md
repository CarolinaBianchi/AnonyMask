---

AnonyMask is a browser-based application for anonymizing images by blurring faces and license plates. It uses **TensorFlow.js** with the `webgl` backend to perform face and plate detection directly in your browser, ensuring privacy compliance with GDPR and similar regulations.

---

## **Features**

- Detects faces and license plates in images.
- Pixelates or masks sensitive areas for GDPR compliance.
- Fully client-side â€“ no data leaves your browser.
- Lightweight and easy to set up.

---

## **Setup**

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anonymask.git
cd anonymask
yarn install # or npm install
yarn start  # Start the development server
yarn build  # Build for production
```

## **How it Works**

### Model

AnonyMask uses a YOLOv8-based model converted to TensorflowJs.

### Use a Different Model

You can replace the YOLOv8 model with another model trained for object detection:

1. Export your YOLOv8 model to TensorFlow.js format:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load your custom YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO("custom-yolov8.pt")  # Replace with your model path

# Export the model to TensorFlow.js format
model.export(format="tfjs")
```

2. Add the exported model to the `/public` directory.

3. Update modelName in `App.jsx`:

```javascript
const modelName = 'custom-model'; // Replace with the new model name
```

4. Update Labels: the corrent model only has two classes: faces and plates, update `src/utils/labels.json` to include your new class names.

## Example

To anonymize an image:

- Click "Upload Image" in the browser interface.
- AnonyMask detects faces and license plates in the uploaded image.
- Pixelated or blurred areas are displayed in real time.
- Download the anonymized image directly from your browser.

## GDPR and Privacy

AnonyMask processes all data locally in your browser, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR. No data is sent to a server.

## License

This project incorporates model weights from [DashcamCleaner](https://github.com/tfaehse/DashcamCleaner/tree/72fcbfd0eaa488de8f010544ce1db8c8523b025a), which is also licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0. Any derivative works of this project must comply with the terms of this license.

## Model Weights

The model weights used in AnonyMask are based on the YOLOv8n model provided by [DashcamCleaner](https://github.com/tfaehse/DashcamCleaner/tree/72fcbfd0eaa488de8f010544ce1db8c8523b025a), licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0.

To make these weights compatible with TensorFlow.js, they were converted from their original Python TensorFlow format to TensorFlow.js format using the following process:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the original YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO("DashcamCleaner/dashcamcleaner/weights/720p_nano_v8.pt")

# Export the model to TensorFlow.js format
model.export(format="tfjs")
```
